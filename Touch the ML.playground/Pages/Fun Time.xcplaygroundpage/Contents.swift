 ## Fun Time
 
 The playground is over here. You can switch datasets by tapping the output visualization box and do some experiments you want.
 
 There are a lot of things that I didn't talk about. For example, how to adjust parameters? how to improve the model accuracy? and many more. It's too hard to cover those topics in 3 minutes. If you are interested in these contents, you can check the related documents.
 
 I hope you like this playground. Have a nice day!
